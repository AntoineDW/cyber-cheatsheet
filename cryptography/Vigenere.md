# Vigenere

The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text where each letter of the plaintext is encoded with a different Caesar cipher, whose increment is determined by the corresponding letter of another text, the key. 

## Encrypt a plaintext using a key
```bash
python3 /opt/vigenere/encrypt.py [plaintext] [key]
```

## Decrypt a cyphertext using a key
```bash
python3 /opt/vigenere/decrypt.py [cyphertext] [key]
```
